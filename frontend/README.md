This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Navigation Bar: Active Tab Highlighting & Accessibility

The bottom navigation bar provides quick access to all major app sections (Inbox/Tasks, Training, History, Settings). It is designed mobile-first and is always visible at the bottom of the screen.

### Active Tab Highlighting
- The navigation bar automatically highlights the active tab based on the current route.
- Only one tab is highlighted at any time, using a distinct color, background, and font weight for clarity.
- The highlight updates instantly as you navigate between sectionsâ€”no manual refresh required.

### Accessibility
- The active tab includes `aria-current="page"` for screen reader support.
- All navigation items are keyboard accessible (tab/enter/space) and have a minimum touch target of 44x44px for mobile usability.
- Focus styles are visible for keyboard users, and color contrast meets accessibility guidelines.

You can find the implementation in `src/components/BottomNav.tsx`.

## Responsive Layout Approach

This application is designed mobile-first and is fully responsive across device sizes:

- **Mobile-first:** All layouts and components use mobile-friendly styles by default, with enhancements for larger screens (see `app/layout.tsx`).
- **Touch targets:** All interactive elements (buttons, nav items) have a minimum touch target of 44x44px for accessibility and usability.
- **No horizontal scrolling:** Layouts use flex/grid and max-width constraints to prevent horizontal scrolling on mobile devices.
- **Typography:** Font sizes are set to remain legible at all standard screen sizes (minimum 16px body text).
- **Navigation:** The bottom navigation bar is fixed, always visible, and adapts to mobile and desktop widths.
- **Component responsiveness:** Task cards, skeletons, and empty states are styled to stack and scale appropriately on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

**QA status:**
- Desktop and mobile layouts have been manually tested and verified.
- Tablet emulation is still pending and should be completed to ensure full coverage.
