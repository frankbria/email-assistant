# Sprint 2 – AI Email Assistant User Stories

## Target Users: Busy solopreneurs and executives managing overflowing inboxes.
## Goal: Enhance the task-based email assistant with security, filtering, and multi-user foundations.

---

## 🔹 User Story 1: Email Settings Configuration

> **As a user**, I want to toggle basic email settings,  
> **so that** I can control spam filtering and auto-categorization preferences.

### 🛠️ TASK
- Create UI components for email settings (toggles/checkboxes)
- Implement API endpoints to get and update settings
- Store user preferences persistently

### 🌟 INPUTS
- Toggle state changes from the UI
- User preference selections

### 🏱 OUTPUTS
- Updated user settings stored in the database
- API responses confirming settings changes
- UI reflecting current settings state

### 🯩 DEPENDENCIES
- User settings model
- Frontend settings component

### ⚡ EDGE CASES
- First-time users → apply sensible defaults
- Failed settings updates → provide error feedback and retry options
- Settings conflicts → resolve with clear precedence rules

### ✅ ACCEPTANCE TESTS
- Frontend toggle settings (checkboxes or toggles) function correctly
- API endpoints for GET/PATCH settings (/api/v1/settings/email) work as expected
- Settings persist per user (or use default settings in single-user mode)
- Changes to settings are immediately reflected in the UI

#### Comments on settings in scope:
| Setting | Why it's in scope |
|:---|:---|
| ✅ Enable/Disable Spam Filtering | Can simply be a flag. Spam filtering can later map to rule-based filters or AI settings we already plan. |
| ✅ Enable/Disable Auto-categorization | Ties directly to Sprint 2 action generation from emails. Simple boolean to toggle. All tasks will be assigned the default 3 actions (reply, forward, archive) |
| ✅ Skip Low-Priority Emails | We already have the concept of priority or 'needs boss attention'. This can be a toggle to suppress low-priority tasks in the UI. |

## 🔹 User Story 2: Secure Email Reception

> **As a system admin**, I want secure incoming email reception,  
> **so that** only trusted forwarding sources can create tasks.

---

## 🔹 User Story 5: Email Receiving Service

### 🯩 DEPENDENCIES
- Task card UI component
- Forwarded email parsing data (already implemented)

### ⚡ EDGE CASES
